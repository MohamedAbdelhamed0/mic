   - Test your microphone to verify it's working

4. **Play Music**:

## Troubleshooting

If you experience distorted or corrupted sound:

1. **Check Voice App Mode**: Make sure "Voice App Mode" is enabled
2. **Try Different Quality**: Lower the quality setting if sound is distorted
3. **Adjust Volume**: Keep volume moderate to prevent clipping
4. **Restart Applications**: Sometimes Discord needs to be restarted to recognize audio changes
5. **Check Default Devices**: Make sure Windows is not using VB-Cable as your system default device
